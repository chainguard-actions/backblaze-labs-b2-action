A Backblaze-maintained B2 GitHub Action. TypeScript-native, built on [@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-sdk-typescript). Thirteen verbs covering every B2 operation a CI workflow needs. Currently incubating in [Backblaze Labs](https://github.com/backblaze-labs).

- **Node 24 action.** No Docker. Sub-second cold start.
- **Thirteen verbs.** `upload`, `download`, `sync`, `copy`, `delete`, `presign`, `list`, `hide`, `unhide`, `verify`, `retention`, `head`, `purge`: pick via the `action` input.
- **Resumable multipart uploads** for any file size; streaming I/O so multi-GB payloads don't buffer in RAM.
- **Server-side everything.** `copy` (same-bucket or cross-bucket) and `delete` operations stay server-side; bytes never traverse the runner.
- **Server-side encryption.** SSE-B2 (managed) and SSE-C (customer key, base64).
- **Object Lock.** Governance/compliance retention + legal hold via the `retention` verb.
- **Bi-directional sync.** Local → B2 *and* B2 → local, with auto-detect.
- **Structured outputs.** `file-id`, `content-sha1`, `bytes-transferred`, `files-listed`, `presigned-url`, `verified`, `summary-json`, more.
- **Step-summary tables** rendered on every run via `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, capped at 100 per-file rows with an omitted-row notice.
- **Secret-safe.** App keys, auth tokens, and presigned URLs are auto-masked with `::add-mask::`.

> **Live test suite = the examples.** Every workflow under [.github/workflows/example-*.yml](./.github/workflows/README.md) is both a copy-paste-runnable example and a live integration test. All but one run on every PR; [the ML cache round-trip](./.github/workflows/example-ml-cache-sync.yml) is push-only because it runs `uses: ./` with B2 secrets.

## Quick start

```yaml
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1 # tip: pin to a commit SHA for production; see Pinning and versioning
  with:
    action: upload
    application-key-id: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID }}
    application-key: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY }}
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: ./build/app.tar.gz
    destination: releases/${{ github.ref_name }}/app.tar.gz
```

For one self-contained example per verb (each is also a live integration test), see [.github/workflows/](./.github/workflows/README.md). Below is the full reference.

## Pinning and versioning

This Action follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) and maintains a floating major tag. Pick the ref style that matches your risk tolerance:

- **`@v1`** tracks the latest `1.x` release. It is convenient and picks up patches automatically, but it is a **mutable** tag: it is moved to each new release, so the code that runs can change without any change to your workflow.
- **`@vX.Y.Z`** is a pinned, SSH-signed release tag, so it shows as **Verified** on GitHub and is easy to audit. Note that a Git tag is still a movable ref, so treat this as a stable, verifiable pointer rather than an immutability guarantee.
- **`@<full-commit-sha>`** is fully immutable and is what we recommend for anything beyond experimentation. It guarantees the exact code that runs cannot change underneath you, even if a tag is moved. If you enable [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) GitHub Actions updates in your repository, it keeps SHA pins current and rewrites the trailing version comment for you.

```yaml
# Recommended for production: pin to a full-length commit SHA.
# With Dependabot GitHub Actions updates enabled, it bumps the SHA + comment for you.
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@<commit-sha> # vX.Y.Z
```

This is the same supply-chain practice this Action applies to its own workflows: every third-party action it depends on is SHA-pinned. The worked examples below use `@v1` for brevity; swap in a commit SHA (or a pinned `@vX.Y.Z`) for production workflows.

Exact-version releases publish an attested `dist/index.js` asset for provenance checks; see [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md#verifying-release-provenance).

## Verbs

| Verb | What it does | Required inputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `upload` | Single-file or glob upload. Streams the file from disk so multi-GB payloads stay memory-bounded; auto-routes to multipart for large files. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `download` | Single-file or prefix-bulk download. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `sync` | Mirror a local directory ↔ a B2 prefix. Direction auto-detected. | `source`, `destination`, `bucket` |
| `copy` | Server-side copy. Same bucket by default; cross-bucket with `source-bucket`. | `source`, `destination`, `bucket` |
| `delete` | Exact name: removes only the latest version, preserving history. Prefix (trailing `/`): removes **every** version under it via `b2_list_file_versions`, same as `purge`. Supports `dry-run` and `bypass-governance` for governance-retained versions. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `list` | List files under a prefix; emits JSON for downstream steps. | `bucket` (and usually `source`) |
| `hide` | Soft-delete via hide marker. Underlying data preserved until lifecycle. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `unhide` | Restore a hidden file by deleting its top hide marker. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `verify` | HEAD-request the remote whole-file SHA-1 and compare to `expected-sha1` or `destination` (local file). No body transfer; multipart objects cannot be verified when B2 does not expose a whole-file SHA-1. | `source`, `bucket`, plus one of `expected-sha1` / `destination` |
| `presign` | Time-limited download URL via `b2_get_download_authorization`. The live URL is masked and exposed only as `presigned-url`; prefix mode exposes only the first generated URL. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `retention` | Apply Object Lock retention + legal hold to a file. | `source`, `bucket`, plus `retention-mode` and/or `legal-hold` |
| `head` | Fetch object metadata (size, sha1, contentType, fileInfo) via HEAD. No body transfer. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `purge` | Permanently delete every file version under a prefix, including hide markers and history. Whole-bucket purge requires `allow-bucket-purge: true`. Supports `dry-run` and `bypass-governance` for governance-retained versions. | `source` or `allow-bucket-purge`, `bucket` |

Exact-name `copy`, single-file `delete`, and `retention` operate only when the latest exact-name version is an upload. If that latest version is a hide marker, these commands do not search older upload history under the same name; they fail with the same `File not found` diagnostic used for absent names so default workflow logs do not reveal hidden-object existence. Run `unhide` first to restore the prior upload, or use `purge` when you need to remove hide markers and historical versions.

## Worked examples

> These examples use `@v1` for brevity. For production, pin to a commit SHA; see [Pinning and versioning](#pinning-and-versioning).
>
> Examples after the first few also omit `application-key-id` / `application-key` for brevity. Those runs need the credentials from somewhere: either add both inputs, or set `B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID` and `B2_APPLICATION_KEY` once at the job level and let the fallback chain pick them up.

### Upload a single file

```yaml
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: upload
    application-key-id: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID }}
    application-key: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY }}
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: ./build/app.tar.gz
    destination: releases/${{ github.ref_name }}/app.tar.gz
```

### Upload with metadata and content headers

```yaml
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: upload
    application-key-id: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID }}
    application-key: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY }}
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: ./build/app.tar.gz
    destination: releases/${{ github.sha }}/app.tar.gz
    content-type: application/gzip
    file-info: |
      build_sha=${{ github.sha }}
      source_ref=${{ github.ref_name }}
      owner=release-engineering
    cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
    content-disposition: attachment; filename="app.tar.gz"
    preserve-mtime: true
```

### Upload a directory with globs

```yaml
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: upload
    application-key-id: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID }}
    application-key: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY }}
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: ./dist
    destination: site/
    exclude: '**/*.map, .git/**'
```

### Download a file or a prefix

```yaml
# Single file
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: download
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: cache/node_modules.tar
    destination: ./node_modules.tar

# Prefix (note the trailing slash)
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: download
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: releases/v1.2.3/
    destination: ./downloads
```

### Sync (both directions)

```yaml
# Auto: local-dir source -> upload sync. Remote prefix -> download sync.
# Tilde-prefixed sources are ambiguous under auto; set direction explicitly.
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: sync
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: ./public
    destination: site
    compare-mode: modtime
    keep-mode: delete   # up sync: removes REMOTE files not present locally

# Force B2 → local (cache restore). Leave keep-mode at no-delete here:
# on a down sync, keep-mode: delete removes LOCAL files missing from B2.
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: sync
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: caches/${{ runner.os }}
    destination: ./.cache
    direction: down
```

### Server-side copy (same-bucket or cross-bucket)

```yaml
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: copy
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: releases/v1.2.3/app.tar.gz
    destination: releases/latest/app.tar.gz

# Cross-bucket: promote staging → prod
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: copy
    bucket: my-prod-bucket          # destination
    source-bucket: my-staging-bucket # source
    source: app.tar.gz
    destination: app.tar.gz
```

### List, dry-run-delete, delete

```yaml
- id: ls
  uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: list
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: tmp/
    max-results: 5000

- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: delete
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: tmp/
    dry-run: true
```

### Hide / unhide

```yaml
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: hide
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: legacy/old.tar.gz

- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: unhide
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: legacy/old.tar.gz
```

### Verify SHA-1 without downloading

```yaml
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: verify
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: releases/v1.2.3/app.tar.gz
    destination: ./app.tar.gz          # compare to local file
    # OR pin to a known-good literal from your release manifest:
    # expected-sha1: 3b1d2e8c9...
```

`verify` is HEAD-only: it compares against the whole-file SHA-1 that B2 exposes
in object metadata. Multipart-uploaded objects may have no whole-file SHA-1 in
B2, so `verify` cannot validate them without downloading and hashing the object;
supplying `expected-sha1` does not help when the remote digest is unavailable.
When B2 reports a non-comparable remote SHA-1 such as `none` or
`unverified:<sha1>`, `verify` publishes `verified=false` outputs before failing
the step; comparable SHA-1 mismatches also fail.

### Presign a download URL

```yaml
- id: link
  uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: presign
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: reports/2026-q1.pdf
    presign-ttl: 7200

- name: Fetch the artifact
  env:
    REPORT_URL: ${{ steps.link.outputs.presigned-url }}
  run: curl -fSL "$REPORT_URL" -o report.pdf
```

### Server-side encryption

```yaml
# SSE-B2 (B2-managed key, no cost)
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: upload
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: ./private.tar.gz
    destination: private.tar.gz
    sse: B2

# SSE-C (customer-provided 256-bit key, base64)
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: upload
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: ./secret.tar.gz
    destination: secret.tar.gz
    sse: C:${{ secrets.B2_SSE_C_KEY_B64 }}
```

#### Generating an SSE-C key

The `sse: C:<value>` input expects a **base64-encoded 32-byte (256-bit) key**. Generate one with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

That outputs ~44 characters. Paste the generated value into a GitHub repository secret (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`): convention is `B2_SSE_C_KEY_B64`.

A few things to know before you commit to SSE-C:

- **You own the key, Backblaze does not.** B2 never stores it. **Lose the key, lose the data**: no recovery.
- **The same key must be supplied at download time** as was used at upload. The action's `download` verb takes the same `sse: C:<key>` input.
- **Rotating the key invalidates any existing SSE-C objects** encrypted with the old value. You'd need to download-then-reupload everything with the new key.
- **The action auto-masks the key** in workflow logs via `::add-mask::`, but that masking does not survive copy-paste. Keep secrets out of bug reports.

If you don't need customer-managed keys, **`sse: B2`** (SSE-B2, B2-managed) is the simpler choice and has zero key-loss risk.

### Object Lock retention + legal hold

```yaml
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: retention
    bucket: my-locked-bucket
    source: audits/2026-q1.tar.gz
    retention-mode: compliance
    retention-until: '2031-04-01T00:00:00Z'
    legal-hold: 'on'
```

Set `bypass-governance: true` to shorten governance-mode retention or to remove governance-retained versions with `delete` or `purge`. The B2 application key must include the `bypassGovernance` capability, in addition to the delete or retention capabilities required by the selected verb.

### Chain outputs

```yaml
- id: up
  uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: upload
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: ./build/app.tar.gz

- name: Record the upload
  env:
    FILE_ID: ${{ steps.up.outputs.file-id }}
    FILE_SHA1: ${{ steps.up.outputs.content-sha1 }}
    FILE_BYTES: ${{ steps.up.outputs.bytes-transferred }}
  run: |
    echo "Uploaded file ID: $FILE_ID"
    echo "SHA-1:            $FILE_SHA1"
    echo "Bytes:            $FILE_BYTES"
```

## Inputs (full reference)

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `action` | yes | | One of 13: `upload`, `download`, `sync`, `copy`, `delete`, `presign`, `list`, `hide`, `unhide`, `verify`, `retention`, `head`, `purge` |
| `application-key-id` | no\* | | B2 application key ID. Falls back to `$B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID`. |
| `application-key` | no\* | | B2 application key. Falls back to `$B2_APPLICATION_KEY`. |
| `bucket` | yes | | Destination bucket name. |
| `source-bucket` | copy only | `bucket` | Source bucket for cross-bucket copy. The key must reach both buckets (read on the source, write on the destination), so a key restricted to a single bucket cannot do this. |
| `source` | command-dependent | | Local path/glob (upload/sync up); B2 file name or prefix (everything else). Local paths and globs expand a leading `~` or `~/` to the runner home directory and reject `~/..` escapes; B2 keys never are. With `sync` `direction: auto`, an expandable tilde source that exists locally is treated as ambiguous and must use explicit `direction`. Prefix downloads reject keys with empty, `.`, `..`, or control-character path segments. For whole-bucket purge, omit `source` or set `/` and set `allow-bucket-purge: true`. |
| `destination` | command-dependent | | B2 file/prefix (upload/sync up/copy); local path (download/sync down/verify). Local destinations expand a leading `~` or `~/` and reject `~/..` escapes; parent directories are created as needed. Upload destinations are not normalized by the action; SDK/B2 key validation errors are surfaced rather than silently rewriting `/` characters. |
| `include` | no | | CSV of glob patterns to include (upload). |
| `exclude` | no | `.git/**` | CSV of glob patterns to exclude (upload). |
| `concurrency` | no | `4` | Parallel parts/files. Must be a positive decimal integer. |
| `part-size` | no | SDK default | Multipart part size in bytes. Must be a positive decimal integer. |
| `resume` | no | `true` | Reserved. Currently not honored; the action's streaming upload source is non-sliceable, so retries do a full re-upload. Kept in the input surface so it can light up if a `BufferSource` fallback ships. |
| `content-type` | no | `b2/x-auto` | MIME type for uploads. |
| `file-info` | no | | Upload fileInfo metadata as newline- or simple comma-separated `key=value` pairs. Use newline-separated entries when values contain commas. Keys are normalized to lowercase, may contain letters, digits, and B2-supported special characters, cannot start with `b2-`, and must fit B2 fileInfo limits. Use `cache-control`, `content-disposition`, `content-language`, or `expires` for reserved `b2-*` response headers. |
| `cache-control` | no | | Cache-Control response header to store with uploaded files. |
| `content-disposition` | no | | Content-Disposition response header to store with uploaded files. |
| `content-language` | no | | Content-Language response header to store with uploaded files. |
| `expires` | no | | Expires response header to store with uploaded files. |
| `preserve-mtime` | no | `false` | Store each uploaded file's local modification time as B2 `src_last_modified_millis`. |
| `dry-run` | no | `false` | Preview only (sync/delete/purge). |
| `allow-bucket-purge` | purge only | `false` | Permit `purge` to target the entire bucket when `source` is empty or `/`. |
| `presign-ttl` | no | `3600` | Presigned URL TTL in seconds. Must be a positive decimal integer. |
| `endpoint` | no | | Override B2 realm (staging/custom). |
| `fail-on-empty` | no | `true` | Fail if an upload glob matches zero files. |
| `sse` | no | | Server-side encryption: `B2` (SSE-B2) or `C:<base64-32-byte-key>` (SSE-C). SSE-C keys must use canonical base64 and decode to exactly 32 bytes. |
| `compare-mode` | no | `modtime` | Sync comparison: `modtime` \| `size` \| `none`. |
| `keep-mode` | no | `no-delete` | Sync deletion of destination-only files: `no-delete` \| `delete` \| `keep-days`. Deletion applies to whichever side is the destination, so a `down` sync with `delete` removes **local** files. |
| `keep-days` | no | | Retention window in days. Destination-only files younger than this are kept. Recommended when `keep-mode` is `keep-days`; omitting it preserves the v1 legacy SDK default with a warning. Warns and is ignored with other `keep-mode` values. |
| `direction` | no | `auto` | Sync direction: `auto` \| `up` (local→B2) \| `down` (B2→local). |
| `max-results` | no | `1000` | `list` upper bound. Must be a positive decimal integer. Truncation is reported in the step summary. |
| `expected-sha1` | no | | `verify` literal 40-character hexadecimal SHA-1 to compare against; malformed values fail the action before comparison. Non-comparable remote SHA-1 headers such as `none` or `unverified:<sha1>` publish `verified=false` outputs before failing the step. |
| `retention-mode` | no | | `retention` mode: `compliance` \| `governance` \| `none`. |
| `retention-until` | no | | `retention` ISO 8601 expiry (required when mode is compliance/governance). |
| `legal-hold` | no | | `retention` legal-hold value: `on` \| `off`. |
| `bypass-governance` | no | `false` | Allow governance-mode retention bypass for retention changes and `delete`/`purge` removals. Requires the B2 application key to include `bypassGovernance`. |

\* Either set the input or one of the env-var fallbacks.

## Outputs (full reference)

| Output | When | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `file-id` | upload / copy / hide / retention / head; unhide if a hide marker was removed | B2 file ID. For `unhide`, this identifies the removed hide marker, not the target object. |
| `file-name` | single-file ops | B2 file name (path). |
| `content-sha1` | upload / download / head when available | SHA-1 hex. Omitted when B2 does not expose a whole-file SHA-1, including multipart objects. |
| `bytes-transferred` | upload / download / sync / copy / head | Total bytes moved. Head emits `0`. |
| `file-count` | every command | Aggregate count of files matched or processed, including skipped sync entries and dry-run delete/purge matches. Prefer verb-specific count outputs when available. |
| `files-uploaded` | upload / sync up | Count. |
| `files-downloaded` | download / sync down | Count. |
| `files-deleted` | delete / purge / sync | Count. |
| `files-listed` | list / prefix presign | Count returned (capped by `max-results`). |
| `presigned-url` | presign | Time-limited download URL. Masked as a secret. This is the only structured output that carries the live presigned URL. |
| `verified` | verify | `true` / `false`. |
| `remote-sha1` | verify | Normalized comparable remote SHA-1, raw non-comparable B2 value such as `none` or `unverified:<sha1>`, or empty when B2 does not expose one. |
| `local-sha1` | verify | Local file SHA-1 (when computed from `destination`). |
| `summary-json` | every command | Complete JSON array with per-file details when the result fits within 256 KiB of UTF-8 JSON text. When the result exceeds the cap, this output is `[]` instead of changing shape or emitting a partial array. Credential-like fields are omitted by name for every command. For `presign`, entries omit live presigned URLs. |
| `summary-json-truncated` | every command | `true` / `false`. Always emitted. `true` means the full manifest exceeded the supported `summary-json` size cap. |
| `summary-json-notice` | every command when truncated | Small JSON object describing why `summary-json` was truncated and where to find the bounded preview. |
| `summary-json-preview` | every command when truncated | Bounded partial JSON array with the first 100 entries that fit the cap. Do not treat it as a complete manifest. Credential-like fields are omitted by name for every command. For `presign`, entries omit live presigned URLs. |
| `retryable` | classified SDK failures | `true` only when the failed action is safe to re-run automatically. Mutating actions with ambiguous transient failures emit `false` so callers inspect B2 state first. |
| `retry-after` | classified SDK failures | Retry delay in seconds, clamped to 3600. Emitted only with `retryable=true`; network failures use a default backoff. |

`summary-json` is complete-or-empty-on-truncation: it never changes shape and never carries a silently partial array. Consumers that parse `summary-json` as an array must first branch on `summary-json-truncated`; when it is `true`, the scalar count outputs (`file-count`, `files-listed`, `files-uploaded`, and the other verb-specific counts) remain the authoritative totals and may exceed the number of entries in `summary-json-preview`. Do not use `summary-json-preview` as an authoritative manifest for security-sensitive checks; fail or fetch a complete manifest another way.

For upload entries, `fileInfo` contains SDK-returned metadata when B2 reports it; if the SDK response omits metadata, the action falls back to the canonical fileInfo submitted with the upload request.

When truncated, `summary-json-notice` contains `{ "truncated": true, "reason": string, "totalCount": number, "previewCount": number, "previewOutput": "summary-json-preview" }`.

For every command, `summary-json` and `summary-json-preview` omit fields with credential-bearing names (`url`, fields ending in `url`, and fields containing `authorization`, `signature`, or `token`, ignoring case, underscores, and hyphens). If a future command needs to expose a similarly named non-secret value, it must project it to an explicit safe field name before emitting the summary.

For `presign`, `summary-json` and `summary-json-preview` contain only non-secret manifest fields such as `fileName` and `expiresAt`; the dedicated `presigned-url` output is the only structured output that contains a bearer URL. In prefix mode, only the first generated URL is exposed through `presigned-url`; bulk URL fan-out through `summary-json` is intentionally unsupported because those URLs are credentials. Generate or handle additional URLs in a trusted step that treats them as secrets.

`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` per-file tables render at most the first 100 rows. When more rows exist, the summary includes a `Showing first 100 of N rows.` notice and the scalar outputs keep reporting the full source count. Status cells are escaped and rendered as inline code so object metadata cannot break the markdown table.

`retryable` and `retry-after` are emitted only on the failure path, immediately before the Action calls `core.setFailed`. To consume them, set `continue-on-error: true` on the B2 step and guard the follow-up step explicitly:

```yaml
- id: b2
  uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  continue-on-error: true
  with:
    action: list
    bucket: ${{ vars.B2_BUCKET }}

- name: Retry after a safe transient failure
  if: steps.b2.outputs.retryable == 'true'
  env:
    RETRY_AFTER: ${{ steps.b2.outputs['retry-after'] || '30' }}
  run: |
    sleep "$RETRY_AFTER"
    echo "retry the read-only operation here"
```

Treat `retry-after` as server-influenced input even though this Action clamps it; do not pass it to unbounded sleeps or shell code without your own policy.

## Running locally from the CLI

This is a GitHub Action, not a published CLI, but the bundle is a plain Node script you can run directly for a local smoke test. It reads the same `INPUT_*` variables Actions sets (each `action.yml` input maps to `INPUT_<NAME>`, upper-cased), and falls back to `B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID` / `B2_APPLICATION_KEY` for credentials:

```bash
INPUT_ACTION=list INPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket \
  B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID=... B2_APPLICATION_KEY=... \
  node dist/index.js
```
