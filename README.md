The Backblaze B2 GitHub Action. TypeScript-native, built on the official [`@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk`](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-sdk-typescript). Thirteen verbs covering every B2 operation a CI workflow needs.

- **Node 24 action.** No Docker. Sub-second cold start.
- **Thirteen verbs.** `upload`, `download`, `sync`, `copy`, `delete`, `list`, `hide`, `unhide`, `verify`, `presign`, `retention`, `head`, `purge`: pick via the `action` input.
- **Resumable multipart uploads** for any file size; streaming I/O so multi-GB payloads don't buffer in RAM.
- **Server-side everything.** `copy` (same-bucket or cross-bucket) and `delete` operations stay server-side; bytes never traverse the runner.
- **Server-side encryption.** SSE-B2 (managed) and SSE-C (customer key, base64).
- **Object Lock.** Governance/compliance retention + legal hold via the `retention` verb.
- **Bi-directional sync.** Local → B2 *and* B2 → local, with auto-detect.
- **Structured outputs.** `file-id`, `content-sha1`, `bytes-transferred`, `files-listed`, `presigned-url`, `verified`, `summary-json`, more.
- **Step-summary tables** rendered on every run via `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.
- **Secret-safe.** App keys, auth tokens, and presigned URLs are auto-masked with `::add-mask::`.

> **Live test suite = the examples.** Every workflow under [.github/workflows/example-*.yml](./.github/workflows/README.md) is both a copy-paste-runnable example and an integration test that runs on every PR.

## Quick start

```yaml
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: upload
    application-key-id: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID }}
    application-key: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY }}
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: ./build/app.tar.gz
    destination: releases/${{ github.ref_name }}/app.tar.gz
```

For one self-contained example per verb (each is also a live integration test), see [.github/workflows/](./.github/workflows/README.md). Below is the full reference.

---

## Verbs

| Verb | What it does | Required inputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `upload` | Single-file or glob upload. Streams the file from disk so multi-GB payloads stay memory-bounded; auto-routes to multipart for large files. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `download` | Single-file or prefix-bulk download. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `sync` | Mirror a local directory ↔ a B2 prefix. Direction auto-detected. | `source`, `destination`, `bucket` |
| `copy` | Server-side copy. Same bucket by default; cross-bucket with `source-bucket`. | `source`, `destination`, `bucket` |
| `delete` | Single file by name, or prefix-bulk via `b2_list_file_versions`. Supports `dry-run`. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `list` | List files under a prefix; emits JSON for downstream steps. | `bucket` (and usually `source`) |
| `hide` | Soft-delete via hide marker. Underlying data preserved until lifecycle. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `unhide` | Restore a hidden file by deleting its top hide marker. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `verify` | HEAD-request the remote SHA-1 and compare to `expected-sha1` or `destination` (local file). No body transfer. | `source`, `bucket`, plus one of `expected-sha1` / `destination` |
| `presign` | Time-limited download URL via `b2_get_download_authorization`. URL is masked. Prefix mode returns one URL per file. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `retention` | Apply Object Lock retention + legal hold to a file. | `source`, `bucket`, plus `retention-mode` and/or `legal-hold` |
| `head` | Fetch object metadata (size, sha1, contentType, fileInfo) via HEAD. No body transfer. | `source`, `bucket` |
| `purge` | Permanently delete every file version under a prefix, including hide markers and history. Supports `dry-run`. | `source`, `bucket` |

## Worked examples

### Upload a single file

```yaml
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: upload
    application-key-id: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID }}
    application-key: ${{ secrets.B2_APPLICATION_KEY }}

  with:
    action: sync
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: ./public
    destination: site
    compare-mode: modtime

  with:
    action: sync
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: caches/${{ runner.os }}
    destination: ./.cache

  with:
    action: copy
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: releases/v1.2.3/app.tar.gz
    destination: releases/latest/app.tar.gz

# Cross-bucket: promote staging → prod

  uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: list
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: tmp/
    max-results: 5000

- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: delete
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: tmp/
    dry-run: true
```

### Hide / unhide

```yaml
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with: { action: hide, bucket: my-bucket, source: legacy/old.tar.gz }

- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with: { action: unhide, bucket: my-bucket, source: legacy/old.tar.gz }
```

### Verify SHA-1 without downloading

```yaml
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: verify
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: releases/v1.2.3/app.tar.gz
    destination: ./app.tar.gz          # compare to local file
    # OR pin to a known-good literal from your release manifest:
    # expected-sha1: 3b1d2e8c9...
```

### Presign a download URL

```yaml
- id: link
  uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: presign
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: reports/2026-q1.pdf
    presign-ttl: 7200

- run: curl -fSL "${{ steps.link.outputs.presigned-url }}" -o report.pdf
```

### Server-side encryption

```yaml
# SSE-B2 (B2-managed key, no cost)
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with: { action: upload, bucket: my-bucket, source: ./private.tar.gz, destination: private.tar.gz, sse: B2 }

# SSE-C (customer-provided 256-bit key, base64)
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: upload
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: ./secret.tar.gz
    destination: secret.tar.gz
    sse: C:${{ secrets.B2_SSE_C_KEY_B64 }}
```

#### Generating an SSE-C key

The `sse: C:<value>` input expects a **base64-encoded 32-byte (256-bit) key**. Generate one with:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

That outputs ~44 characters (e.g. `JXqRk7TZUyDhPmlAv9pn0WzgQGkBNyfwHJtoMSCRXNc=`). Paste the value into a GitHub repository secret (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`): convention is `B2_SSE_C_KEY_B64`.

A few things to know before you commit to SSE-C:

- **You own the key, Backblaze does not.** B2 never stores it. **Lose the key, lose the data**: no recovery.
- **The same key must be supplied at download time** as was used at upload. The action's `download` verb takes the same `sse: C:<key>` input.
- **Rotating the key invalidates any existing SSE-C objects** encrypted with the old value. You'd need to download-then-reupload everything with the new key.
- **The action auto-masks the key** in workflow logs via `::add-mask::`, but that masking does not survive copy-paste. Keep secrets out of bug reports.

If you don't need customer-managed keys, **`sse: B2`** (SSE-B2, B2-managed) is the simpler choice and has zero key-loss risk.

### Object Lock retention + legal hold

```yaml
- uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: retention
    bucket: my-locked-bucket
    source: audits/2026-q1.tar.gz
    retention-mode: compliance
    retention-until: '2031-04-01T00:00:00Z'
    legal-hold: 'on'
```

### Chain outputs

```yaml
- id: up
  uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1
  with:
    action: upload
    bucket: my-bucket
    source: ./build/app.tar.gz

- run: |
    echo "Uploaded file ID: ${{ steps.up.outputs.file-id }}"
    echo "SHA-1:            ${{ steps.up.outputs.content-sha1 }}"
    echo "Bytes:            ${{ steps.up.outputs.bytes-transferred }}"
```

| `legal-hold` | no | | `retention` legal-hold value: `on` \| `off`. |
| `bypass-governance` | no | `false` | Allow shortening a governance retention (requires the capability). |

\* Either set the input or one of the env-var fallbacks.

## Development & contributing

The internal architecture (dispatcher flow, source layout, conventions, CI gates) and local commands live in [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md). The PR / release process is in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

Security reports: see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## Running locally from the CLI

This is a GitHub Action, not a published CLI, but the bundle is a plain Node script you can run directly for a local smoke test. It reads the same `INPUT_*` variables Actions sets (each `action.yml` input maps to `INPUT_<NAME>`, upper-cased), and falls back to `B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID` / `B2_APPLICATION_KEY` for credentials:

```bash
INPUT_ACTION=list INPUT_BUCKET=my-bucket \
  B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID=... B2_APPLICATION_KEY=... \
  node dist/index.js
```
