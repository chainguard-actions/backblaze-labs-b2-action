## Checklist

- [ ] `pnpm all` passes locally (lint + typecheck + test + build).

- [ ] If a new input or output was added: documented in `action.yml` and the README table.
- [ ] If user-visible behavior changed: a [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) entry under `[Unreleased]`.
- [ ] If a new example workflow was added: listed in [`.github/workflows/README.md`](./workflows/README.md) and runs against the project's test bucket.
