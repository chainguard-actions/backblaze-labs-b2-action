## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-04

### Security

- Hardened release/test tooling to clear GitHub security-scanning findings: bearer-token-like test data is no longer committed as a contiguous literal, release-provenance checks reuse parsed step bodies, mutation-report paths sanitize POSIX and Windows separators, and mutation-report tables share one column definition. ([#176](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/176))
- Bumped pinned CI action SHAs, `biome.json`, and development dependencies to clear GitHub Dependabot security alerts. ([#175](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/175))

### Added

- Local path inputs now expand a leading `~` or `~/` to the runner's home directory: `source` for `upload` and `sync` up, `destination` for `download`, `sync` down, and `verify`, plus `include` / `exclude` globs. Action inputs are not shell-expanded, so `destination: ~/.cache/huggingface` previously created a literal `~` directory inside the workspace, while `@actions/glob` already expanded `~` for upload patterns. B2 keys are never tilde-expanded because `~` is a legal key character. `~user` forms are passed through with a warning, and `~/..` paths are rejected because the expanded path would leave the runner home directory. ([#164](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/164))
- `keep-days` input: the retention window for `keep-mode: keep-days`, which the action never forwarded to the SDK. The SDK defaults the window to 0 days, so `keep-mode: keep-days` can delete every destination-only file immediately and behave exactly like `keep-mode: delete`. For v1 compatibility, `keep-mode: keep-days` without `keep-days` still parses but emits a deprecation warning; set `keep-days` explicitly to use the intended retention window. A future major release should make the window required. Setting `keep-days` with any other `keep-mode` warns that it is ignored. ([#164](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/164))
- `sync` warns when `direction: auto` resolves to a B2-to-local sync while `source` still looks like a local path (`~`, `./`, `../`, or a Windows drive). Auto-detection treats "not an existing local directory" as "must be a B2 prefix", so a mistyped or not-yet-created local path silently reversed the intended direction. ([#164](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/164))
- `upload` file metadata and content headers: new `file-info` (custom `X-Bz-Info-*` entries), `cache-control`, `content-disposition`, `content-language`, and `expires` inputs, plus `preserve-mtime` to record the local file's modification time. Uploaded-file entries in the `summary-json` output now include the resolved `fileInfo`. ([#135](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/135))

### Changed

- Updated the `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk` dependency from `^0.1.0` to `^0.2.0`.
- `bypass-governance` now also covers `delete` and `purge`, not just retention changes: it is forwarded to Object Lock delete operations, so a governance-locked file can be removed when the application key has the capability. ([#132](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/132))

### Deprecated

- `keep-mode: keep-days` without an explicit `keep-days` value. It still parses but emits a deprecation warning, and because the SDK defaults the window to 0 days it deletes destination-only files immediately (like `keep-mode: delete`). Set `keep-days` explicitly; a future major release will require it. ([#164](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/164))

### Fixed

- `sync`: `direction: auto` now fails closed for an expandable tilde-prefixed `source` that exists as a local directory, because the same string can also be a valid B2 prefix. Set `direction: up` for a local home-directory upload or `direction: down` for a B2-prefix download. This is a version-to-version behavior change for `~`-prefixed auto sources that briefly resolved as uploads after tilde expansion was added. ([#164](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/164))
- `upload`: glob matches outside the working directory no longer produce B2 keys containing `..` path segments. The key was computed with `relative(process.cwd(), match)`, so a pattern such as `/tmp/build/*.bin` yielded keys like `artifacts/../../../tmp/build/a.bin`. Those objects uploaded successfully but this action's own prefix `download` then refused to map them back onto disk, so they could not be restored. Keys are now resolved against the first containing root (the working directory first, so in-workspace globs keep their existing keys, then the glob's own search paths), falling back to the basename. ([#164](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/164))
- `upload`: multi-file uploads now fail before any upload starts if two local files would map to the same final B2 file name after destination remapping. This avoids silent overwrites from same-basename files matched through multiple absolute roots or basename fallback. ([#164](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/164))
- `copy`: abort signals now flow through both small-file and large-file copy paths, so workflow cancellation behaves consistently. ([#131](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/131))
- `file-info`: oversized metadata entries are now checked against the remaining total metadata budget, producing one coherent limit instead of a value-only limit that could still fail the final total check. ([#135](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/135))
- `copy`: large cross-bucket copies now land in the destination bucket. `copyLargeFile` was never sent the destination bucket id, so a large file copied across buckets was silently written back into the source bucket. ([#131](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/131))

### Documentation

- README and `.github/workflows/README.md`: the example suite no longer claims that every `example-*.yml` runs on pull requests. `example-ml-cache-sync.yml` is `push` + `workflow_dispatch` only because it runs `uses: ./` with B2 secrets, which a pull request could modify; `__tests__/workflow-policy.test.ts` enforces that.
- README: worked examples after the first few omit the credential inputs, which now says so and points at the `B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID` / `B2_APPLICATION_KEY` fallback rather than leaving the snippets to fail with a missing-credential error.
- README: the `presign`, chain-outputs, and `retry-after` examples pass step outputs through `env:` instead of interpolating `${{ }}` into `run:` bodies, matching the example workflows and the repository's own guidance about `retry-after`.
- README: `keep-mode` states that deletion applies to whichever side is the destination, so a `down` sync with `keep-mode: delete` removes local files; the sync examples say the same inline.
- README: the `delete` verb row distinguishes exact-name deletes (latest version only, history preserved) from prefix deletes (every version, same as `purge`).
- README: `source-bucket` notes that cross-bucket `copy` needs a key that reaches both buckets, so a single-bucket-restricted key cannot do it.
- Release and contributor docs now include the pre-release coherence checklist, pin pnpm via the `packageManager` field, use `pnpm run docs` for TypeDoc, and document that the link checker skips generated `docs/` output.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-23

### Security

- Pin every third-party GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/` to a full commit SHA (with an exact `# vX.Y.Z` comment), so a moved or compromised upstream tag cannot alter our CI or the `contents: write` release job. Dependabot keeps the pins current. ([#18](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/18))
- Run workflow security through the shared `backblaze-labs/github-actions` composite action in `.github/workflows/security.yml`, covering actionlint, third-party action pin checks, and zizmor audits without duplicating those scripts in this repo. ([#18](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/18))
- Add signed GitHub Artifact Attestations for the release `dist/index.js` bundle from an isolated provenance job, upload the attested bundle plus a SHA-256 checksum as release assets, and document `gh attestation verify` provenance checks for consumers. ([#19](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/19))
- Harden the release path so release tags must point at reviewed `main` commits, protected `vX.Y.Z` tag rulesets are documented as required setup, and stable releases move the floating `vN` tag before the GitHub Release is made public. ([#19](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/19))
- Add a dependency vulnerability gate: a CI `audit` job runs `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level high` (available locally as `pnpm run audit`), failing the build on a high or critical advisory in a production dependency. Scoped to production deps so a dev-tooling advisory cannot block an unrelated PR. ([#21](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/21))
- Add a CodeQL (SAST) workflow (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) that statically analyzes the TypeScript source on every PR to `main`, on push to `main`, and weekly, surfacing findings in the repo Security tab. Uses `build-mode: none` (no compile needed) and SHA-pinned `github/codeql-action`. ([#20](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/20))
- Add a full-lockfile dependency audit workflow and heartbeat for dev/build tooling, with per-change PR/push visibility plus weekly/manual default-branch tracking issues. Bound `vite`, `js-yaml`, `markdown-it`, and `undici` overrides to patched current-major ranges. ([#35](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/35))

### Added

- Add a weekly real-B2 large multipart smoke workflow that uploads a payload above B2's recommended part size, downloads it, checks SHA-1 integrity, and deletes the test prefix. ([#25](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/25))
- Add property-based and adversarial tests for SSE-C parsing, input coercion, upload/download path mapping, and SHA-1 normalization. ([#51](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/51))

### Changed

- `download`: prefix downloads now preflight path mapping before writing files and reject B2 keys that cannot be mapped safely into the destination directory, including empty, `.`, `..`, and control-character path segments; legal POSIX names are preserved verbatim on POSIX runners, while Windows-only reserved path forms are rejected instead of silently rewritten. ([#51](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/51))
- Input validation now rejects non-canonical SSE-C base64 keys, requires positive integer inputs to use safe decimal integer syntax, and requires `verify` `expected-sha1` values to be 40-character hexadecimal digests. ([#51](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/51))
- `upload`: directory/glob uploads now consistently treat `destination` as a prefix even when the source resolves to a single file; only an explicit single-file source treats a non-trailing-slash `destination` as the exact object key.
- `summary-json` now has an explicit 256 KiB UTF-8 cap. Results that exceed it no longer fail an otherwise successful B2 operation or emit a partial array under `summary-json`; instead the Action sets `summary-json-truncated=true`, keeps `summary-json` as `[]`, writes a small truncation object to `summary-json-notice`, and emits a bounded `summary-json-preview` for diagnostics. Migration note: consumers must branch on the always-emitted `summary-json-truncated` output first, and use `file-count` plus verb-specific count outputs for authoritative totals when it is `true`. Credential-like fields are omitted by name from `summary-json` and `summary-json-preview` for every command. ([#41](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/41))
- Breaking change for prefix-mode `presign` consumers: live presigned download URLs are no longer written into `summary-json` or `summary-json-preview`; the dedicated `presigned-url` output remains the only bearer-URL channel and exposes only the first URL in prefix mode. Bulk prefix-mode URL retrieval through `summary-json` is intentionally unsupported. ([#41](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/41))
- `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` per-file tables now render at most the first 100 rows and include a `Showing first 100 of N rows.` notice when rows are omitted. This includes `presign`, whose previous command-specific cap was 50 rows. Status cells are escaped and rendered as inline code for markdown safety. Scalar count outputs continue to report the full count. ([#41](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/41))
- Stable releases now move the floating major tag (`v1`, `v2`, ...) before publishing the GitHub Release, fail early when `FLOATING_TAG_TOKEN` is absent or unusable, and document the manual `workflow_dispatch` override for emergency releases. ([#28](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/28))

### Fixed

- `download`: completed bodies are written through same-directory temporary files and renamed into place, so an existing leaf symlink is replaced instead of followed out of the destination root. ([#51](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/51))
- `verify`: remote SHA-1 headers that B2 reports as non-comparable values such as `unverified:<sha1>` now return a structured `verified=false` result with a diagnostic reason instead of aborting inside SHA-1 normalization; the action still fails closed after publishing outputs. ([#51](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/51))
- `pnpm docs:links` now downloads, verifies, and runs a pinned lychee binary on supported local platforms, and CI uses the same command, so contributors can reproduce the markdown-link gate from a clean checkout where lychee publishes a matching binary. ([#39](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/39))
- Top-level action failures now classify known SDK errors into actionable authentication, permission, and transient retry messages, expose failure-path `retryable` / `retry-after` outputs only when an automatic retry is safe, preserve sanitized generic B2 error detail and debug traces, and avoid leaking server-controlled SDK text before logging. ([#27](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/27))

### Documentation

- README: added a "Pinning and versioning" section recommending consumers pin `backblaze-labs/b2-action` to a commit SHA (or a signed `@vX.Y.Z` tag) rather than the mutable `@v1` floating tag, mirroring the supply-chain practice the Action applies to its own workflows.
- README: use version-neutral exact-tag examples, link release provenance checks, and clarify that prefix-mode `presign` exposes only the first live URL via the masked `presigned-url` output.
- README: document that exact-name `copy`, single-file `delete`, and `retention` operate only when the latest exact-name version is an upload; a latest hide marker is reported with the same `File not found` diagnostic as an absent name so default logs do not reveal hidden-object existence. ([#31](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-action/issues/31))

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-29

Release-pipeline, Marketplace metadata, and dependency hygiene. No runtime behavior changes; consumers pinning `uses: backblaze-labs/b2-action@v1` get this automatically.

### Changed

- `action.yml`: Marketplace listing name set to `Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage Action` (must be globally unique on the Marketplace; independent of the repo path `backblaze-labs/b2-action` used in `uses:`). Description trimmed to under 125 characters (Marketplace cap).
- README: tagline calls this the **official** Backblaze B2 GitHub Action; Marketplace badge points at the new listing slug `backblaze-b2-cloud-storage-action`.
- `release.yml` tag trigger restricted to three-component semver (`vX.Y.Z` and `vX.Y.Z-*`). The floating `v1` / `v2` aliases the workflow itself moves no longer match the trigger, so re-pointing them never re-runs the release.
- `release.yml` User-Agent bake gate now checks for the `b2-github-action/` token and the inlined version string independently. ncc tree-shakes the JSON import in `src/version.ts` so the two appear separately in the bundle, not as one contiguous literal.
- Bumped Dependabot devDeps: `cspell` 9 → 10, `@types/node` → 25.9.x, `vitest` and `@vitest/coverage-v8` → 4.1.7, `actions/upload-pages-artifact` v3 → v5, `actions/deploy-pages` v4 → v5.

### Fixed

- `.husky/pre-push` no longer uses `set -o pipefail`: husky sources hooks with `sh` (dash on Linux runners), where `pipefail` is an illegal option. The hook now uses `set -eu`. The release workflow also sets `HUSKY=0` so the in-CI `git push` of the floating major tag doesn't re-trigger local hooks.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` excludes `@backblaze-labs/*` from `minimumReleaseAge` so a freshly-published SDK release doesn't block `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in CI.
- The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot create or move a tag whose commit contains workflow files. `release.yml` now uses a `FLOATING_TAG_TOKEN` secret (a PAT or GitHub App token with `workflows` permission) for the floating-tag step, and skips with a warning instead of failing if the secret is absent.

### Added

- SSH-signed tag support documented in [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md): set `git config --global tag.gpgSign true` once and `pnpm version` produces signed annotated tags.
- [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md) consolidates the release runbook, workflow internals, and one-time setup (signed tags, `FLOATING_TAG_TOKEN`, first Marketplace publish). Release-process documentation now lives in one place; CONTRIBUTING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, and README.md just link there.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-28

Initial release. Built on [`@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk`](https://github.com/backblaze-labs/b2-sdk-typescript) `^0.1.0`.

### Added: thirteen verbs

- `upload`: single file or glob upload. Streams via fs ReadStream → Web ReadableStream so multi-GB payloads don't buffer in RAM. Multipart auto-routes via the SDK when size exceeds the recommended part size, with `concurrency`, `part-size`, `resume` controls.
- `download`: single file (by basename, exact path, or into an existing directory) or prefix-bulk (when `source` ends with `/`).
- `sync`: bi-directional mirror between a local directory and a B2 bucket prefix. `direction: auto | up | down` auto-detects from `source`. Supports `compare-mode` (modtime / size / none), `keep-mode` (no-delete / delete / keep-days), and `dry-run`.
- `copy`: server-side copy via `b2_copy_file` (small) or `b2_copy_part` (large). Same-bucket or cross-bucket via `source-bucket`. Bytes never traverse the runner.
- `delete`: single file by name, or prefix-bulk via `b2_list_file_versions` streamed through the SDK's `deleteAll`. Supports `dry-run`.
- `list`: list files under a prefix, emit JSON as a step output for downstream consumers; reports truncation against `max-results`.
- `hide`: soft-delete via hide marker (thin wrapper around `b2_hide_file`).
- `unhide`: restore a hidden file by deleting its top hide marker (wraps the SDK's `bucket.unhide()`).
- `verify`: HEAD-request the remote SHA-1 and compare to `expected-sha1` or a local file at `destination`. No body transfer. Reports `verified`, `remote-sha1`, `local-sha1` outputs.
- `presign`: time-limited download URL via `b2_get_download_authorization`. URL is masked with `core.setSecret`. Prefix mode (trailing `/`) generates one URL per file under the prefix, capped by `max-results`.
- `retention`: Object Lock retention (compliance/governance) + legal hold on a file version. Requires a fileLock-enabled bucket.
- `head`: HEAD-only metadata probe (size, sha1, contentType, fileInfo, uploadTimestamp) without transferring the body.
- `purge`: permanently delete every file version under a prefix, including hide markers and historical uploads. Differs from `delete` in intent (wipe-and-rebuild) and emits a loud warning when no prefix is specified. Supports `dry-run`.

### Added: cross-cutting

- Node 24 JavaScript action bundled with `@vercel/ncc`.
- Server-side encryption: `sse: B2` (SSE-B2) or `sse: C:<base64-32-byte-key>` (SSE-C). MD5 of the SSE-C key is computed internally with `node:crypto`.
- `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` markdown table written by every command, with per-file rows and totals.
- Credential resolution chain: action input → `B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID` / `B2_APPLICATION_KEY` env var. The standard names used by the Backblaze `b2` CLI and the official SDK.
- Auto-masking of the application key, the resulting auth token, and any presigned URL via `core.setSecret`.
- Custom User-Agent attribution (`b2-github-action/<version>`) so Backblaze server-side logs can identify CI traffic.

### Added: quality gates

- Vitest suite (156 tests across 13 files) running against the SDK's in-memory `B2Simulator`. No real network.
- Coverage gate (`pnpm test:coverage`): 95 % statements / 85 % branches / 100 % functions / 95 % lines. Current run: **100 % / 100 % / 100 % / 100 %**.
- CI workflow with six jobs: `test` (Ubuntu / macOS / Windows matrix), `lint` (Biome `--error-on-warnings`), `coverage`, `build-and-check-dist` (with a 4 MiB bundle-size budget), `actionlint`, and `self-smoke` (offline bundle invocation).
- Tag-driven release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) that runs the full gate, cuts a GitHub Release, and moves the floating major tag (`v1`, `v2`, …) to track the latest minor/patch.
- Dependabot config for weekly npm + github-actions updates.
- Twelve example workflows under `.github/workflows/example-*.yml` that double as live integration tests against a real B2 test bucket. See [.github/workflows/README.md](.github/workflows/README.md) for the catalogue. There is no separate `integration.yml`; the examples *are* the integration suite.

### Added: community files

- `SECURITY.md` with redaction guidance and a 30-day coordinated-disclosure timeline.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documenting the "add a new verb" pattern, style conventions, and release process.
- `CODEOWNERS` defaulting to `@backblaze-labs/maintainers`, with elevated ownership of `release.yml`, `ci.yml`, `dist/`, `action.yml`, and `SECURITY.md`.
- `.editorconfig` mirroring Biome's settings for contributors whose IDE doesn't have Biome wired up.
- `.github/FUNDING.yml` pointing at the Backblaze B2 free-tier signup as the "support the project" path.
- Issue templates: `bug_report.yml`, `feature_request.yml`, plus `config.yml` directing security reports + B2-service questions + SDK bugs to the right places.
- Pull request template with a checklist (build, dist, tests, README, CHANGELOG).
- Status + Quality + Tech-stack + Community badge rows in the README (CI, Release, Marketplace, Latest release, License, Tests, Coverage, Bundle size, Verbs, Examples, TypeScript, Node 24, Biome, SDK attribution, No-Docker, PRs welcome, Open issues, Stars, Backblaze).
- Mermaid architecture diagram in the README "How it works" section.

### Added: operational

- `daily-smoke.yml` workflow: runs the most-used verbs end-to-end against a real B2 test bucket once a day. Catches B2 API drift or SDK regressions before user-reported issues.

### Deferred (not planned for v1.x)

- Bucket-level admin verbs (`create-bucket`, `update-bucket-lifecycle`, `set-notification-rules`, replication config). Their inputs are arrays-of-objects that don't fit the flat `with:` input shape; an admin-focused Action or Terraform provider is a better home.

### Inputs

`action`, `application-key-id`, `application-key`, `bucket`, `source-bucket`, `source`, `destination`, `include`, `exclude`, `concurrency`, `part-size`, `resume`, `content-type`, `dry-run`, `presign-ttl`, `endpoint`, `fail-on-empty`, `sse`, `compare-mode`, `keep-mode`, `direction`, `max-results`, `expected-sha1`, `retention-mode`, `retention-until`, `legal-hold`, `bypass-governance`.

### Outputs

`file-id`, `file-name`, `content-sha1`, `bytes-transferred`, `files-uploaded`, `files-downloaded`, `files-deleted`, `files-listed`, `presigned-url`, `verified`, `remote-sha1`, `local-sha1`, `summary-json`.
