/**
 * Build an authorized B2Client.
 *
 * Steps:
 *   1. Construct the client with `userAgent: 'b2-github-action/<version>'`. The
 *      SDK preserves its own `b2-sdk-typescript/` and `@backblaze-labs/b2-sdk` tokens before
 *      ours so Backblaze server-side logs see both attribution layers.
 *   2. `await client.authorize()`. This is one-shot for the lifetime of the
 *      action invocation. B2 auth tokens carry a 24h TTL; typical GitHub
 *      Actions runs finish well inside that window. If a long-running job
 *      outlives the token, the SDK transparently re-authorizes on the next
 *      401, so the action layer does not need its own refresh loop.
 *   3. Use an AccountInfo wrapper that masks each account authorization token
 *      as it is stored, including SDK-driven reauthorization after token
 *      expiry. The post-authorize mask is kept as a fallback in case a future
 *      SDK version bypasses the wrapper for initial authorization.
 *
 * The `transport` parameter is only used by tests (the SDK's B2Simulator
 * provides one). Production callers leave it undefined to use the SDK's
 * default FetchTransport with its built-in SSRF guard.
