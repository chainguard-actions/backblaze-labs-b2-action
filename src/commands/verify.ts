 *   1. `expected-sha1` input set → compare the remote object's SHA-1 to that
 *      literal value. No local read.
 *   2. `destination` input is an existing local file → compute that file's
 *      SHA-1 locally and compare to the remote.
 *   3. Neither → fail.
 *
 * In all modes, the remote SHA-1 is fetched via a HEAD request (header
 * `x-bz-content-sha1`). Large files uploaded via multipart return `null` from
 * B2 here because B2 stores the per-part SHA-1s but not a whole-file SHA-1;
 * the verify will fail with a clear message in that case (you should instead
 * compare a known-good `expected-sha1` from your release manifest).
